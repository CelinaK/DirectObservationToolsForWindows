1. EPSG database is stored in this folder (*.mdb). Only one .mdb file should be present in the folder, name can differ according to version.
2. World.state MapWindow4 project which reference files of the sample world project (probably better to duplicate in this folder).
3. World.state definition can be changed in MW4. I changed .mwprj extention to .state to prevent inadvertent editing from users.
