<p>The structure incorporates ductile design, where steel members or reinforcing are designed to undergo plastic deformation in over-load situations before failure under earthquake loads occurs in structural members or their connections. Provision of ductility is achieved by both providing a hierarchy of member strengths in a structural system as well as special member detailing. For example, ductile moment frames will have columns stronger than the beams and shear force detailing will prevent shear failures of both beams and columns occurring before flexural yielding.</p>

<p>Ductile behaviour of steel structures can be achieved using dogbone beam connections (Reduced Beam Section). The dogbone connection consists of trimming a portion of the steel beam flange in the region adjacent to the beam-to-column connection; this type of connection acts as a ductile fuse, and it forces yielding to occur within  the reduced section of the beam; see an I-shaped beam with dogbone connection ready for the construction, Canada (S. Brzev)</p>
